### Thanks for checking out my page

I'm Eric, a data analyst and digital marketing director. I contribute to the strategic direction of marketing campaigns using data-driven insights and sound research. Please check out some of my data work below. 

### Web Game | Cluelist 

This is a simple web game in which the objective of the player is to guess all the items in a list from one clue. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Case Study | Bellabeats 

In this case study I will try to identify times of the day when people wear and do not wear their tracking devices and when they are most active.

### Toronto Community Shelter Flow 

This project is an exploratory analysis of Toronto's Community Shelter Flow using Toronto's Open Data Catalogue. I will try to identify insights based on traffic entering and exiting the shelter system by demographic data and population group.
